# Awesome Recent bookmarks

chrome extensions to list recent bookmarks

## Store URL

<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-resent-bookmarks/ddnfpifnooijlnjhnndijfcbppjdmece?hl=ja" target="_blank">Awesome Resent Bookmarks - Chrome ウェブストア</a>

## Motivation

An extension called "<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recent-bookmarks/olndffocioplakeilhkgenfgdincjlpn?hl=ja" target="_blank">Recent Bookmarks</a>" already existed, but had the following two complaints

- The delete button is difficult to press.
- The number of bookmarks displayed cannot be changed.

Also, there is not much information in Japanese about ChromeAPI, so I had to look at the official documentation.
I thought it would be good practice for me to understand and implement the official documentation.
I tried to make my own extension.
